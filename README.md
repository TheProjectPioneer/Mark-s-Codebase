# Design Patterns Lab (and Beyond)

This repository is my **engineering knowledgebase**, a place where I explore, document, and demonstrate **software design patterns**, architectural practices, and other development concepts across different stacks (currently .NET and Angular).

The goal is not just to re-implement patterns blindly, but to:
- **Show the intent** of each pattern (the "why").
- **Demonstrate the implementation** in different technologies (.NET / Angular).
- **Contrast naive vs. pattern-based approaches**, so the trade-offs are clear.
- **Keep everything small and runnable**, with per-pattern demos and tests.
- **Build a personal playground** where I can expand beyond design patterns later.

## Structure

- `/net` → .NET implementations (C#, xUnit, console demos).  
- `/angular` → Angular workspace (one demo app + one lib per pattern).  
- `/docs` → Explanations, UML diagrams (PlantUML / Mermaid), notes.  

Each pattern is isolated as a **subproject** (per language)

## The 23 GoF Design Patterns

The **Gang of Four** design patterns fall into three categories: **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral**.  
Below is the list I’ll be going through and demonstrating in this repo.

### Creational Patterns
1. **Factory Method**  
2. **Abstract Factory**  
3. **Builder**  
4. **Prototype**  
5. **Singleton**

### Structural Patterns
6. **Adapter**  
7. **Bridge**  
8. **Composite**  
9. **Decorator**  
10. **Facade**  
11. **Flyweight**  
12. **Proxy**

### Behavioral Patterns
13. **Chain of Responsibility** 
14. **Command**  
15. **Interpreter**  
16. **Iterator**  
17. **Mediator**  
18. **Memento**  
19. **Observer**  
20. **State**  
21. **Strategy**  
22. **Template Method**  
23. **Visitor**
